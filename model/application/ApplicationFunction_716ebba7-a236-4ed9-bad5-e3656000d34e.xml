    documentation="Data preparation in MOA Environment is done by copying data from DOA Environment (this&#xD;&#xA;copy/paste is run in the same tool: CorePDM). This duplication of data between DOA and MOA environment may also consists in splitting reference: one P/N from DOA is split into several P/N in MOA (LSA BOM). All the split is done in CorePDM. Maintenance Operations are then linked to the right LSA P/N into CorePDM."/>
