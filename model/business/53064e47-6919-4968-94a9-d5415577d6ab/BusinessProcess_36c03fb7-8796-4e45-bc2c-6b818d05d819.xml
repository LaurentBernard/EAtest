    documentation="When a change occurs, there is an alert to inform the LSA P/N that are potentially impacted.&#xD;&#xA;The issue is to identify physically or via the P/N in the DOA environment. The need is to have an access to the 3D from the MOA environment into the CorePDM. It means a direct access to the MOA environment from the 3D (Today, the operating mode is sequential and based on 2 different solutions:&#xD;&#xA;search the P/N into the 3D ILS Prepa, copy/paste the P/N once found, then search into the CorePDM).&#xD;&#xA;One key pain points is the lack of interactivity between both solutions 3D ILS Prepa and CorePDM. Yet,&#xD;&#xA;to solve this, it requires having all data in Full 3D that is not the case on H160.&#xD;&#xA;In order to help the LSA uses the report form Spotfire Report that indicates which DOA P/N start from.&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;Problem: volume of changes. For H160 program, in the development phase, lot of changes&#xD;&#xA;impact the activity. An additional difficulty is due to the fact that the change process is running&#xD;&#xA;in parallel of the change process for ILS activities.&#xD;&#xA;ILS changes are regrouping several ECP (this results from H175 RETEX H175 => not possible to manage one Change ILS for one engineering change, so appears the concept of batch or&#xD;&#xA;groups).&#xD;&#xA;In development phase (H160 program feedback), the process implemented into the PLM is&#xD;&#xA;too rigid."/>
