    documentation="The RETEX Support organization is a recent organization set up for the H160 program.&#xD;&#xA;The goal of the organization is to integrate as early as possible the requirements from supportability&#xD;&#xA;into the design. Since the Direct Operating Costs are 3 times the cost of the machine, the supportability&#xD;&#xA;is a key differentiator to be integrated in the very early phase. So this integrated team with the design&#xD;&#xA;Office proposes options/trade off to the designers to reduce/optimize the maintenance:&#xD;&#xA;- Step 1: recommendations,&#xD;&#xA;- Step 2: requirements,&#xD;&#xA;- Step 3: supportability analysis,&#xD;&#xA;- Step 4: critical design supportability.&#xD;&#xA;Requirements are formalized and stored into a database. These requirements are&#xD;&#xA;verified/tested/demonstrated.&#xD;&#xA;The RETEX is collected by:&#xD;&#xA;- PSM : product support manager (niveau 1)&#xD;&#xA;- Tech Rep&#xD;&#xA;- Hot line technic (Expert)&#xD;&#xA;Any qualitative data is then analyzed and processed to be transformed into qualitative information.&#xD;&#xA;Once this step is performed, the goal consists in defining the best compromise according to predefined&#xD;&#xA;criteria (design, reliability, maintainability). The RETEX database (WebTech) gathers all that&#xD;&#xA;information. Yet, in terms of cultural change the RETEX culture needs to be re-inforced into some&#xD;&#xA;organization (e.g.: less RETEX oriented in Germany)."/>
