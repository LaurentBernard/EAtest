    documentation="ILS planning is part of the change process and redefine planning according to the ECP received.&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;Context: H160&#xD;&#xA;The main pain points for the planning:&#xD;&#xA;- Lack of a single solution to plan activities,&#xD;&#xA;- Lack of a solution connected to the system in which deliverables are produced,&#xD;&#xA;- Not all disciplines are part of the change process,&#xD;&#xA;- Not easy to use solutions for planning (OPX tools, CorePDM),&#xD;&#xA;- Too many solutions and data spread over too many solutions (OPX, CorePDM, SCDM, SAP&#xD;&#xA;Pricing, EBP, Spotfire, sharepoint for internal and external collaboration, 3D Prepa, 3D Player,&#xD;&#xA;NECTAR for the certification documents).&#xD;&#xA;For the H160 program, approximately 350 ECP for data creation and 150 ECP for update for the 1st&#xD;&#xA;baseline. As an average, it is key to keep in mind up to 400 ECP per year.&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;H175 ILS planning &amp; management&#xD;&#xA;H175 program is currently developing 2 new versions:&#xD;&#xA;- VIP&#xD;&#xA;- Public services&#xD;&#xA;For the H175 program, changes are tracked down to the iteration. For the H175, this is up to 600&#xD;&#xA;changes a year, representing 2000 issues a year.&#xD;&#xA;Note that in serie phase, approximately 250 to 300 changes are issued per year.&#xD;&#xA;What are the main issues:&#xD;&#xA;- Because of the process, high volume of information is lately delivered,&#xD;&#xA;- The access of the data requires many tools: ECPDM (Catia / VPM), EPP175, SAP, PUZZLE&#xD;&#xA;(note that PUZZLE should migrate to CorePDM),&#xD;&#xA;- Technical problem when installing on the machine (problem of industrialization),&#xD;&#xA;- Low level of commitment on ILS costs due to high number of iteration of changes,&#xD;&#xA;- Access to the data of the ILS Disciplines.&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;Improvements Axis&#xD;&#xA;As improvements for the ILS :&#xD;&#xA;- Feedback from production about the rank of embodiment of a change,&#xD;&#xA;- Lack of study to determine the opportunity to integrate the change earlier on the machine&#xD;&#xA;and on already delivered machines,&#xD;&#xA;- Better visibility of the helicopter configuration,&#xD;&#xA;- Reduce the variability to reduce the volume/costs of stocks,&#xD;&#xA;- Right first time.&#xD;&#xA;"/>
