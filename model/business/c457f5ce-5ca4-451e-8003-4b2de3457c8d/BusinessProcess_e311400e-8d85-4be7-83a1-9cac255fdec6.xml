    documentation="The time preparation for 10 Design Solutions is estimated to 2 days to prepare. An average for an&#xD;&#xA;analysis is about 15 days (identification of operations, procurable parts, tasks, etc). On top of that, the&#xD;&#xA;analysis may take 15 days including the sequencing.&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;The main issues are:&#xD;&#xA;- Issue on the process: some data are fulfilled by LSA but should be fulfilled by DO ;&#xD;&#xA;- Some data are in the documents but should be digitalized (this induce a lot of time without&#xD;&#xA;added value) ;&#xD;&#xA;- When information is missing or dispatch over several sources from the Design Office, the&#xD;&#xA;Supportability Analysis completes the data.&#xD;&#xA;Once analysis performed, 15 days to define the sequence in CorePDM.&#xD;&#xA;Some metrics for H160:&#xD;&#xA;- 60~70 analysis. Supportability organization runs approx. 1 analysis with 5 days of workload;&#xD;&#xA;- For Systems analysis, approx. 70 basics systems to be analyzed, and to be added options;&#xD;&#xA;- 50 analysis for options have to be run.&#xD;&#xA;- So as an average, for one H/C standard approx. 70 analysis with options this represents about&#xD;&#xA;100 analysis&#xD;&#xA;The benefits can be estimated from 25 to 30 % in terms of time reduction (from 30 to 20 days) by&#xD;&#xA;enhancing the data preparation and continuity.&#xD;&#xA;"/>
