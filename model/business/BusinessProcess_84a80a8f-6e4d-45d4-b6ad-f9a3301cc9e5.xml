    documentation="From the design office information, the illustrator retrieve from VPM the 3D models or/and the drawings. This retrieving process is tedious and time consuming, because it’s very difficult for a non VPM expert to find the required information (ex: 1 day to retrieve the data to make a single illustration for a very simple piece of product). Sometimes, the necessary information is embedded in VPM “Black Boxes “, thus complicating even more the task. The global complexity of this process leads to use personal internal networks to have the job done, and increase the global lead time. &#xD;&#xA;The data coming from the Digital Mock-up “as is” are unusable by the illustrators. They have a huge amount of work to suppress multiple occurrences of the same parts or design solutions, clean non necessary components, or add missing items. &#xD;&#xA;The verification of the consistency between the flight manuals and the configuration of the delivered machines is not straight forward and is time consuming, due to a lot of different tools.&#xD;&#xA;Time to make a chapter for the H175: 1 week on average.&#xD;&#xA;"/>
